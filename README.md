This code is just a small trial with one of Pikuma's video's on voxel space. The video can be found here: https://youtu.be/bQBY9BM9g_Y

You can 
 * navigate a map controlling the camera with WASD, strafe QE and Up-down arrows for elevation. 
 * manipulate the origin height (PGUP/PGDN). 
 * page through 30 different maps (using numpad + or -).

All credits are for Pikuma, I just ported part of his code to render on the PixelGameEngine by Javidx9 (many thanks to him as well!)

Have fun with it!
